****Content-Based Recommender System****

This repository contains the code for a content-based recommender system. Content-based recommendation systems suggest items similar to those a user has liked in the past, based on the attributes of the items. In this system, movies are recommended to users based on the content/features of the movies they have previously enjoyed.

**Features**

*Content-Based Filtering*: Utilizes content-based filtering techniques to recommend movies to users based on the features of the movies they have liked.

*Movie Feature Analysis*: Extracts features such as genre, actors, directors, and plot keywords from movie metadata to create representations of the movies.

*Vector Comparison*: Computes similarities between movies using vector comparison methods such as cosine similarity.
   
*User Interface*: Provides an interactive user interface for users to input their movie preferences and receive personalized recommendations.
